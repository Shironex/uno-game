Here are some suggestions you could implement to enhance your UNO game:

Leaderboards: Implement a leaderboard to track the highest scorers, or the most number of wins, and display it on the UI.

Power-Ups: You can add power-ups to your UNO game to make it more exciting. For example, a power-up could allow players to skip their turn or draw an extra card.

Customizable Decks: Allow players to customize their decks by selecting the cards they want to use in the game.

In-game rewards and challenges: Implement challenges or rewards for players who achieve specific in-game objectives, such as playing a certain number of cards in a single turn or winning a game with only one card left in their hand.

Social Sharing: Allow players to share their game results or achievements on social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook.

Spectator Mode: Add a spectator mode to allow players to watch ongoing games without participating in them.

Achievements: Implement achievements for players who complete specific goals or milestones within the game.

Tournaments: Organize tournaments with multiple rounds, where players can compete against each other to win prizes.

AI Players: Add AI players to your game to allow single-player mode or to fill empty seats if the maximum number of players is not met.

Game History: Implement a game history feature to allow players to view their previous game statistics and results.

These are just a few ideas to consider. However, make sure to prioritize the core gameplay and mechanics before adding any additional features.
